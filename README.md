## 🧠 What is an `.xDelta` Patch?

`.xDelta` patches are **binary diff files** storing changes between two versions of a file.  
They enable:

- Distributing only the changes (much smaller than full ISOs)
- Applying modifications without sharing copyrighted game data
- Widely used in retro gaming and ROM hack communities
